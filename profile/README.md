# The Alaythia Project

Welcome to **The Alaythia Project**, where we delve into the depths of biblical studies with the aid of technology. Our name, Alaythia, is a transliteration of the Greek word for "truth," reflecting our commitment to uncovering and understanding the profound truths within the Bible.

## About Us
